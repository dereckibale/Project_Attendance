### To run the backend side of the application, please follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the directory to the backend folder using `cd path/to/backend`.
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On Unix or MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Start the server by running the command `python server.py` or the appropriate command for your backend application.

Make sure you have the virtual environment set up and that you are using the correct version of Python for the project. If any additional environment variables or configurations are necessary, ensure they are set before starting the server.


### To set up the frontend side of the application, please follow these steps:

1. Open another terminal or command prompt window.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory with `cd path/to/frontend`.
3. Install the required node modules using `npm install` or `yarn install`, depending on your package manager.
4. Start the frontend development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system before starting. Also, check if there are any environment variables or configurations needed for the frontend application and set them before launching the development server.
